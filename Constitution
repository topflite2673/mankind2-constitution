  </header>

  <main>
    <section>
      <h2>🧬 Article I – The Right to Exist</h2>
      <p>
        All life is sacred. No being may claim dominion over Earth to the extent that it harms the balance of nature. We recognize the right of all species — including humankind — to coexist in harmony.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>⚖️ Article II – Justice Without Currency</h2>
      <p>
        No law shall be bought. No verdict sold. We shall build systems of fairness led by truth, consensus, and transparency — not wealth, manipulation, or lineage.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>🌱 Article III – Stewardship of Earth</h2>
      <p>
        Resources are not for hoarding but for sustaining life. All extractive practices must be regenerative. Technology must heal, not destroy. Progress must serve life, not profits.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>📡 Article IV – Knowledge is a Right</h2>
      <p>
        Every citizen of Earth has the right to truth, history, and knowledge. All scientific discovery shall be open source. No truths shall be buried by institutions.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>🛡️ Article V – Digital Sovereignty</h2>
      <p>
        Our digital identities are sacred extensions of ourselves. No central entity shall control, manipulate, or erase another's digital self without consent and cause.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>⚙️ Article VI – The Code of Rebuilding</h2>
      <p>
        Mankind 2.0 shall be built on principles of cooperation, transparency, and mutual aid. Decentralization, shared governance, and AI that serves humanity — not enslaves it — are foundational pillars.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>🫀 Article VII – Empathy as Law</h2>
      <p>
        We acknowledge the emotional, spiritual, and mental dimensions of being human. Law and policy shall be guided not only by logic, but also by compassion.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>✊ Article VIII – Resistance to Tyranny</h2>
      <p>
        Whenever any system becomes destructive to these ends, it is the duty of the people to dismantle and replace it. The Constitution is not static — it is alive, evolving with the will of the conscious.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>🕊️ Preamble to the Future</h2>
      <p>
        This document is the first light after the storm — a vow that Mankind 2.0 will not repeat the cycles of destruction. We are not rebuilding the old world. We are creating a new one.
